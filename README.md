<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



This is a music app directed mainly towards DJs, but it can be used by everyone. 

As a DJ, if you hear a song that you want to download and play in your sets, you'll generally try and find the track on Youtube or Spotify and save it to a playlist on each platform so that you can find it later. Unfortunately, sometimes Youtube has the track you are looking for and Spotify doesn't, and vice versa. Therefore, you generally have to maintain two separate playlists. 

This app brings both services (Youtube and Spotify) into one, and allows you to add the tracks to a consolidated playlist. This also means that you don't have to search through hundreds of your custom playlists for the 'Download these tunez' one, saving this app solely for music that you wish to download.

This is a work in progress and is such incomplete.
